// 1. Write a C++ program that requests and displays information as shown
// in the following example of output:
//   What is your first name? Betty Sue
//   What is your last name? Yewe
//   What letter grade do you deserve? B
//   What is your age? 22
//   Name: Yewe, Betty Sue
//   Grade: C
//   Age: 22
// Note that the program should be able to accept first names
// that comprise more than one word.
// Also note that the program adjusts the grade downward — that is, up one letter.
// Assume that the user requests an A, a B, or a C so that you don’t have to worry
// about the gap between a D and an F.
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
