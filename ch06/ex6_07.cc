// 7. Write a program that reads input a word at a time until a lone q is entered.
// The program should then report the number of words that began with vowels,
// the number that began with consonants,
// and the number that fit neither of those categories.
// One approach is to use isalpha() to discriminate
// between words beginning with letters and those
// that donâ€™t and then use an if or switch statement to further
// identify those passing the isalpha() test that begin with vowels.
// A sample run might look like this:
//   Enter words (q to quit):
//   The 12 awesome oxen ambled quietly across 15 meters of lawn. q
//   5 words beginning with vowels
//   4 words beginning with consonants
//   2 others
